# Smash Scraper

The purpose of this project is to gather competitive Super Smash Bros Melee tournament data, format it, and enter it into a database.

## Getting Started

This uses **selenium-webdriver** python package, which requires a tool called 'geckodriver'. This is found in the *assets* directory.

Make sure to add this directory to your PATH variables by using the following command:

' export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/directory/smash-scraper/assets '
